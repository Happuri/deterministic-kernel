* v0.1.57-01 other path

In version v0.1.57-01-release = v0.1.57-01-rc there was a mistake that makes this verification different;
You need to copy/move all the files before starting ./run.sh to a other directory this time: /home/kernelbuild/bot_to_build/mempobot/kernelbuild
(or ideally that one should be then symlinked to ~/kernelbuild and run should be run from ~/kernelbuild/ not sure if there is a difference here).

This is needed to get identical checksums, because:

<Irc2PGuest80244> in the files arch/x86/kernel/asm-offsets.s scripts/.conmakehash.cmd and scripts/mod/.empty.o.cmd scripts/.kallsyms.cmd there are paths starting with /home/kernelbuild/bot_to_build/mempobot/kernelbuild

Thank you anonymous report for the information.
This is due to a bug in automatic build bot (not visible in this deterministic-kernel project's git).
