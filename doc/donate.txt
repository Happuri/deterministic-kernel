Donations will be used for:

1. sponsoring some of the developers
2. sponsoring costs like hardware, domains, (software?), bounties(!)
3. sponsoring other people who would help us
4. sponsoring external projects that we cooperate with like grsecurity, tails(?), openwall(?), freenet, tor, i2p, bitcoin, *coin, etc
5. sponsoring other external projects and organisations with goals related to Freedom and Security

probably in this order.

Perhaps in future we will establish organisation or organisations to manage the funds.
