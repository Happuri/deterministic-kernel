Known security problems in this software(*)

* security#1 (bug#7) https://wiki.debian.org/SameKernel#bug7
Our provided configuration should have higher secuirty even in desktop config (-good)
We should turn on UDEREF / KERNEXEC - lack of them probably is what
allowed a possible problem/vulnerability (that someone claims he
was able to exploit).
Impact: security was lowered then it probably could be (no reason to not activeate this options even for desktop?) though higher then vanilla kernel
