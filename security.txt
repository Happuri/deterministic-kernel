* security#1 (bug#7) https://wiki.debian.org/SameKernel#bug7
Our default configuration was with enabled XEN support (default from Debian), 
this option has high security cost as it disables UDEREF and KERNEXEC 
protections of grsecurity/pax. 

In versions up to and including linux-3.2.55-mempo-0.1.35 XEN is enabled and 
security is not so good. Versions above and including 
linux-3.2.55-mempo-0.1.36 will disalbe XEN even for desktop (config-good). 
Still this is not as excellent as full grsecurity, we on purpose disable 
iomem/kmem untill we have gfx drivers packaged that deal with this options.

Impact: protection was not as strong as it could be (cost of XEN support) 
  though still higher then vanilla kernel, but lower then recommended (maximum)
	grsecurity settings.
Evaluation: all mempo kernels still had better security then default debian

Versions: all <= linux-3.2.55-mempo-0.1.35
Fix: (almost) will be >= linux-3.2.55-mempo-0.1.36
Workaround: change config to enable more grsecurity protections, remove CONFIG_XEN, then enable UDEREF and KERNEXEC
Status: wip
